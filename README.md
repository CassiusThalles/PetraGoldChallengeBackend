# Petra Gold Backend Challenge

## Node version
In this repository I use Node v12.6.0

## Installing
first of all, you'll need NodeJS installed on your system.

you can get [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) from official website,
or you can use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to store different versions of NodeJS in your system.
then you just need to run ```npm install```

## Database
In this challenge I used MongoDB as a database and mongoose to connect ExpressJS and MongoDB.
So, don't forget to configure your database connection. The configuration file is the db.js file, located at configs directory.
